                            <h2>Wise Words</h2>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p> <b>"Cleanliness is close to Godliness."</b> 
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    <b>Cleanliness generates healthiness, which generates other aspects of life and most important security, 
                                    but if security and healthiness are there without cleanliness then they are sure to collapse.</b><br/>
                                </p>

                              Through this project we aim at helping municipalities and  corporations to manage the waste in the respective regions in an organised manner. 
                              The proposed Smart Trash System helps municipalities and corporations to monitor waste levels in each bins and allocate timely resources to clear that.
                              More over since future versions of it is solar powered our system becomes more greener and cleaner. 
                              Also we are planning to display public mesages which can be controlled by the monitoring authority in the future version.
                            </p>';
